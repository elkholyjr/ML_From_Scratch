# ML_From_Scratch
Machine Learning algorithm implementations from scratch.

## Algorithms Implemented
### KNN
### Linear Regression
### Logistic Regression
### Naive Bayes
### Perceptron
### SVM
### Decision Tree
### Random Forest
### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
### K-Means
### AdaBoost
### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

NOTE: Do note that, Only numpy is used for the implementations. Others help in the testing of code, and making it easy for us, instead of writing that too from scratch.
